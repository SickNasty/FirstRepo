    <h1 style="color : purple">How the Kings Compare too Other Teams</h1>
    <p style="color:grey">The kings are in the western conference which means
      they play all teams in the west.  They have to go up against team such
      as the sharks and ducks. But within a conference there are divisions.
      The kings are in the Pacific Division while there is the Central
    Division with the Blackhawks, Avalanche etc.  The Kings only play
    the teams in their own division. But when playoffs come around and
     you have to play for the conference championship the two divisions will
     end up playing eachother. But back to what I was saying about how they
    compare to the other teams. They are one of the best in the Pacific Division
     in my opinion but they definetly have some good compitition.  They have to
     play the sharks who made it to the finals this year.  They also  have to play
     against the Oilers who have a very special player. They have Connor Mcdavid
     who went first overall in the NHl Draft and is definetly a star player that
     any hockey fan knows about. </P>
<p style="color:purple"> Overall the Kings havent been a great team in their
       47 year history but they have definetly become a team that is not a joke.
        I think ever since Luc Robitaille and Wayne Gretzky the team has been
        getting better. It did take them a good while to win the Stanley cup
        but to do it in 2012 and 2014 is impressive.  Their all-star line up
        made then winners of what I think is the most coveted trophy in sports.
