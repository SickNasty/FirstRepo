    <h1 style=color:purple>Los Angeles Kings</h1>
    <p style=color:grey>In the nhl there are 30 teams, my favorite of which are <thead>
      LA Kings.  The La Kings became a team in the nhl in 1967.
    They had their firt game against another expantion team from that year, <thead>
    the phildephia flyers. They were one of the two teams that in california
     that were introdiced in the nhl in 1967. In california there were <thead>
       oakland seals and the la kings.  Now the oakland seals are out of the league
     and in the bay area there are the San Jose Sharks.  They made it to the Stanley
    cup finals this year but lost in game 7 to the penguins</P>

       <p style=color:purple>The kings had gotten Wayne Gretzky in 1988.  Wayne gretzky
          joined the LA Kings in 1988. He had previously played
         for the Edmonton Oilers. Edmonton had lost their favorite player, and
         there was definetly mad fans, but Gretzky was no effected and was still
         great in LA. Even though he was good, he never won a stanley cup with
         the LA Kings.  To this day Wayne Gretzky is still the highest scoring
       player in nhl history with 894 goals and 1963 assists</P>
