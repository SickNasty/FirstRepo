    <h1>Los Angeles Kings</h1>
    <p>In the nhl there are 30 teams, my favorite of which are <thead>
      LA Kings.  The La Kings became a team in the nhl in 1967.
    They had their firt game against another expantion team from that year, <thead>
    the phildephia flyers. They were one of the two teams that in california
     that were introdiced in the nhl in 1967. In california there were <thead>
       oakland seals and the la kings.</P>

       <p>The kings had gotten "The Great One" in 1988.  Wayne gretzky, AKA
         "The Great One" joined the LA Kings in 1988. He had previously played
         for the Edmonton Oilers. Edmonton had lost their favorite player, and
         there was definetly mad fans, but Gretzky was no effected and was still
         great in LA. Even though he was good, he never won a stanley cup with
         the LA Kings.</P>
