  <body>
    <p style="color:grey"> The Stanley Cup is the trophy given to the winner of the stanley
      cup finals. You have to get into the playoffs, then win playoffs
      to go into the finals, in which you have to win 4 games to win <thead>
        7 game series.  In 2012 the Kings won the stanley cup againsst <thead>
          New Jersery Devils.  This was they're first stanley cup since they
          were introduced to the NHL in 1967, along with five other teams,
          the California Golden Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, St. Loius Blues,
          Minnesota North Stars, and the Pittsburgh Penguins.
          <p style="color:purple"> Two years late they won their second stanley cup in the 47 years
            they were in the NHL.  This time it was much more of an exciting win
            as it was in double overtime and had been much longer than
            anticipated, especially because the Kings were dominating the finals.
            The game winning goal was scored by Alec Martinez
            and was a rebound goal.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRBtTIY572s"> This is <thead>
              game winning goal in 2014 against the New York Rangers.</a>
            <p style="color:grey"> Since 2014 the Kings have not gotten the the Stanley
              Cup Finals or win a stanley cup.  They are not any worse though, they
              resently had a defender, Drew Doughty win the Norris Trophy for being the best defenseman
              in the league. They have many famous plpayers such as Jonathan Quick, Anze Kopitar
              , and Dustin Brown.  Jonathan quick has been one of the best goalies in the league
              year after year.  Anze Kopitar is an extremely gifted forward who has good
              stick handling and a good shot.  And finally Dustin Brown, many believe he
              is not as good as he used to be but he was one of the strongest forwards
               and he'd level people with his hits.</p>
